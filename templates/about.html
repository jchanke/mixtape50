            <p>Mixtape50 takes a user-given message as input, and returns a playlist of songs whose titles - when put together - form that same message. For example, converting this:</p>
            <p class="mx-5" style="background-color: #073642; border-radius: 4px; padding: 4px 12px;">
                <code>Dear Prudence: I'm so tired. I don't want to spoil the party. When I get home, I'll follow the sun. I'll be back, Rocky Raccoon.</code>
            </p>
            <p>...to this:</p>
            <div id="tracks-list" class="d-flex flex-wrap align-items-center" style="margin: 0 44px 1rem;">
                <div class="track m-1 px-1">dear prudence</div>
                <div class="track m-1 px-1">im so tired</div>
                <div class="track m-1 px-1">i dont want to spoil the party</div>

                <div class="track m-1 px-1">ill follow the sun</div>
                <div class="track m-1 px-1">ill be back</div>

            <p>Kind of like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixtape#Aesthetic">mixtape</a> - an artfully put together cassette of songs that might suggest a mood or message - only considerably less artful, and a lot more direct.</p>
            <p>Admittedly, this example is a little contrived. But it makes clear some of the subproblems we need to solve.</p>
            <p>Let's break them down.</p>

            <h2 class="section-header">Title cleaning</h2>
            <p>Let's say we want to include the word <code>happy</code> in the song. If we search Spotify, we end up with 39 distinct titles. Here is a curated subset of that, to illustrate:</p>
            <table class="table table-sm table-dark">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="col">#</th>
                        <th scope="col">Track</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="row">1</th>
                        <td>Happy</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="row">2</th>
                        <td>Happy - From "Despicable Me 2"</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="row">3</th>

                        <th scope="row">4</th>
                        <td>Happy Birthday to You (Instrumental) [Short Edit 1]</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="row">5</th>
                        <td>GongXi GongXi (Happy Lunar New Year!)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="row">6</th>
                        <td>Happy w u (feat. Jason Dhakal)</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p><b>1</b> is an exact match. <b>2</b> is a close match: we mentally filter out the metadata portion when we read, and all that's left is the message string.</p>
            <p>The rest do not match, but are good examples of some <a href="https://cdn.smehost.net/helpcentertheorchardcom-orchardprod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Spotify-Metadata-Style-Guide-v.2.pdf">common metadata conventions</a> in Spotify track titles.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The artist name, version information, and title translations; within parentheses (<b>3</b>, <b>5</b>) or square brackets (<b>4</b>).</li>
                <li>A featured artist, after <code>feat.</code> and within parentheses (<b>6</b>).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We want to format the titles so that <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> will match our message <code>happy</code>, but not the rest. How? Mixtape50 cleans the track titles in two steps - <strong>cleaning metadata</strong>, and <strong>removing punctuation</strong>.</p>
            <p>In the first step, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html">regular expressions</a> are used to clean metadata by checking for some common patterns:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anything between <code>( )</code> or <code>[ ]</code> (and any number of spaces before that) are removed.</li>
                <li>Any instances of <code>&blank;-&blank;</code> and everything after are removed.</li>
                <li>
                    Any instances of
                    <code>&blank;ft&blank;</code>
                    <code>&blank;ft.&blank;</code>
                    <code>&blank;ft:&blank;</code>
                    <code>&blank;feat.&blank;</code>
                    <code>&blank;feat:&blank;</code>
                    <code>&blank;featuring&blank;</code>
                    and everything after are removed, but not
                    <code>feat</code> or <code>feature</code> (both are legitimate words).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are bundled into <code>clean_title</code>, a function. A second function, <code>remove_punctuation</code> takes the cleaned title as input, and returns a string of words:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>composed of only lowercase alpha-numeric characters,</li>
                <li>separated by single <code>&blank;</code>s.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Putting this together, after searching Spotify, we put it through <code>clean_title</code> and then <code>remove_punctuation</code>. We also put the message string through <code>remove_punctuation</code>. We then return only the results whose cleaned versions exactly equal the cleaned message string.</p>

            <h2 class="section-header">String segmentation</h2>
            <p>This is the meat of the problem: having cleaned the user's message (via <code>remove_punctuation</code>), how can we split it into a list of valid songs (found on Spotify)? More generally, given:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a string, and</li>
                <li>a set of valid substrings (a 'dictionary'),</li>
            </ul>
            <p>how can we partition the string into a list of valid substrings?</p>
            <h3>Theory</h3>
            <p>It turns out that this is a well-known family of problems known as <b>string segmentation</b> or <b>word break</b> problems. The goal is either to determine if a valid partition exists, or to return one (or all) valid partitions.</p>
            <p>One key feature of this problem is that segmentations compose. If we find a valid word in the message, then splitting the remaining sentence substring (which we might call the "submessage") is <em>also a string segmentation problem</em>.</p>
            <p>The problem's structure - that the given problem can be solved by first solving smaller subproblems of the same kind - lends it well to a recursive approach. Consider the short code snippet below:</p>
            <pre><code style="background-color: #073642; font-weight: normal;" class="language-python hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">wordBreak</span>(<span class="hljs-params">message, dictionary, output = []</span>):
    <span class="hljs-comment"># Base case</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> message == <span class="hljs-string">""</span>:
        <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(output)
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment"># Recursive case</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> i <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">range</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">len</span>(message)):
        word = message[:<span class="hljs-built_in">len</span>(message) - i]
        sub_message = message[<span class="hljs-built_in">len</span>(message) - i:]
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> word <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> dictionary:
            <span class="hljs-title functino_">wordBreak</span>(message = sub_message,
                      dictionary = dictionary,
                      output = output + [word])
    <span class="hljs-comment"># Failure case</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return None</span></code></pre>
            <p><code>wordBreak</code> is a function that takes a 'dictionary' of valid words and a message string as input, and prints <em>all possible segmentations</em> to the console. Like other recursive algorithms, it handles a base case and recursive case. (You can tinker with <a href="https://replit.com/@JosephChan2/Mixtape50">this code snippet</a> to run the program here.)</p>
            <p>In the base case (the empty message string <code>""</code>), we print the output to the console, which defaults to the empty list.</p>
            <p>In the recursive case,</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We segment the <code>message</code> into the <code>word</code> and the remaining <code>sub_message</code>.</li>
                <li>We keep decreasing the <code>word</code> length until we find a word in the 'dictionary'.</li>
                <li>If the <code>word</code> is in the 'dictionary', we add the word to the output, and call <code>wordBreak</code> on the remaining substring.</li>
                <li>If the message is segmentable, the last <code>sub_message</code> will be the empty string <code>""</code>, triggering the base case and printing the segmented output to the console.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Because there is no <code>return</code> statement after calling <code>wordBreak</code>, the loop continues after <code>wordBreak</code> has returned - <em>even for successful calls</em>, which print a valid segmentation to the console. This means that all valid segmentations are eventually found.</p>
            <p>Here's an example (adapted from these <a href="https://courses.cs.duke.edu/fall01/cps130/lectures/lect21.pdf">lecture notes from Duke</a>) to demonstrate:</p>

            <p>Let's consider the time complexity of this algorithm. For a <code>message</code> of \(n\) characters, there are \(n-1\) places to segment the string. Since each space can either be segmented or not, there are \(2^{n-1}\) possible segmentations.</p>
            <p>In the worst-case scenario, all possible segmentations are valid, so this algorithm runs in \(O(2^{n-1})\) (exponential time). However, in the best-case scenario, no sub-string beginning with the first character is a valid word, so only \(n\) searches are performed before <code>wordBreak</code> exits. So, the algorithm's asymptotic lower-bound is \(\Theta(n)\) (linear time).</p>
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>This maps nicely to our problem at hand. We just need to substitute:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>single characters with <b>cleaned "words"</b> (<code>happy</code>, <code>dont</code>, etc.),</li>
                <li>valid words with <b>cleaned Spotify track titles</b>, and</li>
                <li>the look-up 'dictionary' with <b>a search on Spotify</b>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the implementation (the function <code>search_message</code> in <code>helpers.py</code>), there are some deviations from the algorithm described above, mostly to reduce runtime.</p>
            <h4>Returning the first result</h4>
            <p>First, like in the algorithm above, <code>search_message</code> starts with the longest possible first track title, decrementing by one word each time. When a valid first track title is found, it calls itself on the remaining submessage. In this way, <code>search_message</code> is "greedy" - it goes with the longest track title starting with the first word (if there is one). This generally results in longer track titles, which is more interesting than having, say, a playlist of mostly one-word track titles.</p>
            <p>However, <code>search_message</code> returns the first valid segmentation <em>and stops</em>, rather than continuing the for loop. What this means is that if a valid segmentation exists, both algorithms are <em>guaranteed</em> to find it. However, while <code>wordBreak</code> generates all valid segmentations (and can choose, say, the shortest one), <code>search_message</code> will not.</p>
            <h4>Limiting track title length</h4>
            <p>Additionally, another speed-up can be achieved by setting a limit on the number of words to search at a time. Some analysis of <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rodolfofigueroa/spotify-12m-songs">a large Spotify track database</a> revealed that most track titles are short - not more than 10 words long. (Most longer track titles are usually either edgy tunes by indie rock bands or long orchestral pieces, both unlikely to be found in a typical message.)</p>
            <p>Therefore, starting the search for the first word with the entire message seems inefficient, especially for long message strings. In the implementation, a parameter <code>max_search_length</code> is set by default to 10 words. <code>search_message</code> will start the search with just first 10 words (or the message length, whichever is shorter), decrementing to nine words, eight words, and so on.</p>
            <h4>Database lookups</h4>
            <p>While <code>wordBreak</code> looked for words in the 'dictionary' (a set), searching Spotify was implemented via an API (in <code>search_spotipy</code> - more on this later.) However, one practical challenge was that many crucial song track titles could not be located. Running <code>search_message</code> on the <a href="https://www.espressoenglish.net/the-100-most-common-words-in-english/">100 most common words in English</a>, only about 20 or so had even a single matching track, causing most messages to trip up on words like <code>the</code> or <code>has</code>.</p>
            <p>The first fix was to additionally query a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rodolfofigueroa/spotify-12m-songs">Kaggle database of 1.2 million+ Spotify tracks</a> if the naive Spotify search did not return results (implemented in <code>search_db</code>). For some reason, this significantly improved coverage, so that about 80 of the 100 most common English words could be matched with Spotify tracks.</p>
            <h4>Memoization</h4>
            <p>The next change was to 'cache' successful and unsuccessful queries. Some substrings, although not segmentable, took a long time to verify. Consider the hypothetical unsegementable substring <code>handsaturnspin<span style="text-decoration: underline;">haha</span></code> in the example above.</p>
            <p><code>handsaturnspin</code> can be split six different ways:</p>
            <div class="d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-center mx-5" style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <code class="m-1">hands at urns pin</code>
                <code class="m-1">hands at urn spin</code>
                <code class="m-1">hands a turn spin</code>
                <code class="m-1">hand saturn spin</code>
                <code class="m-1">hand sat urn spin</code>
                <code class="m-1">hand sat urns pin</code>
            </div>
            <p>Each time this full substring is searched, each possibility will be generated, only to find that <code>haha</code> is not in the 'dictionary'. In the example above, <code>handsaturnspin</code> is actually searched twice: once for the segmentation with <code>"he", "art"</code>, and again for the segmentation with <code>"heart"</code>. This seems wasteful: if <code>handsaturnspin<span style="text-decoration: underline;">haha</span></code> is unsegmentable, there should be no need to search it on both <code>"he art"</code> and <code>"heart"</code>.</p>
            <p>In our code, if the submessage is found to be unsegmentable, it is added to <code>failed_queries</code>, a set of unsegmentable substrings. The next time it is selected, <code>search_message</code> finds that it has already been searched and skips the computation entirely. This technique of 'caching' results is known as 'memoization' in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a>, a computing paradigm that minimises repeated calculations, decreasing the runtime.</p>
            <p>Similarly, successful segmentations (as returned by <code>search_message</code>) are stored in a python dictionary, <code>query_lookup</code>, for future reference.</p>
            <h3>Putting it all together</h3>
            <p>For each submessage:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the submessage is found in <code>failed_queries</code>, we <code>continue</code> to the next iteration of the loop.</li>
                <li>Otherwise, we loop through three search functions in order: <code>search_lookup</code>, <code>search_spotipy</code>, and <code>search_db</code>. These check the cache of successful previous queries, Spotify (via its API), and our Kaggle database respectively.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-header">Creating the playlist</h2>
            <p>This part was comparatively easy. Mixtape50 uses the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/">Spotify API</a> via the <a href="https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/">spotipy</a> python library to create a playlist, and add tracks to it. The Spotify API relies on the OAuth 2.0 authorisation protocol, but the implementation details are thankfully abstracted away by the <code>spotipy</code> library.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2 class="section-header">Coda: server-sent events</h2>
            <p>Unlike the toy example shown earlier, the results take some time to return - usually under a minute - because queries to Spotify's API are rate-limited. To improve the user experience, once the user submits a message, a new tab is opened, which displays the progress of the search in real-time for the user to inspect.</p>
            <p>This presents another challenge: since the search takes place in the server, how can updates be sent live from the server to the client (the browser)? In the typical HTTP paradigm, the server <em>only</em> sends a response after the client sends a request. What we want to do is allow the server to send a response unilaterally, without a prior request from the client.</p>
            <p>After considering a few alternatives like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">WebSocket</a>, I decided to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events">server-sent events (SSE)</a>. Essentially, this allows the client to "subscribe" to a stream of events from the server, until the connection is closed. The flow goes something like this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The client (the browser) sends a request to the server to "subscribe" to updates. (This is handled via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource">EventSource</a>, a vanilla JavaScript interface to server-sent events.)</li>
                <li>Once the EventSource connection is opened, the server can send updates to the client via by setting the <code>Content-Type</code> header to <code>text/event-stream</code>.</li>
                <li>When the search has completed, a final message is sent to the client to close the connection.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most of this is implemented in a JavaScript file, <code>creating.js</code> on the client side, while the server's transmissions are handled via a MessageAnnouncer object in <code>announcer.py</code> (adapted from <a href="https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/flask-sse-no-deps/">this article</a> by Max Halford).</p>

            <h2 class="section-header">Final thoughts</h2>
            <p>If you've made it this far, please accept my sincere thanks - it means a lot to me! If you have any comments or suggestions for improvement, please feel free to contact me, or make a merge request.</p>
            <h3>Limitations and extensions</h3>
            <p>There are quite a few features I'd have liked to implement but for my lack of time, will, and technical ability. I may refactor my code and attempt to do so in future. If it is interesting or of value to you, you are most welcome to contribute!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Improved track title cleaning.</b> There are still a few edge cases, like "I'm Not Okay (I Promise)" (by My Chemical Romance) - this would match <code>i'm not okay</code>, but not <code>i'm not okay, i promise!</code>. Additionally, to reduce the chances of a message tripping up, I'd like to allow, say, the word <code>you</code> to match both "you" and "u", or <code>want to</code> to match "want to", "wanna", or even "wna", in both directions.</li>
                <li><b>Updating the cache into a SQL database directly.</b> Common queries could be cached into a SQL database instead of a python dictionary, allowing for caching to persist between sessions.</li>
                <li><b>Customizing the playlist.</b> Usually, a successful Spotify or database search returns not one, but quite a few songs. Once the screen has loaded, I'd like for the user to be able to choose which of the matching songs to include in the playlist. For example, the user could pick out a specific cover of the matching song, which is in line with the thoughtful, deliberate composition process that defined mixtapes in the past. (Actually, if you open the browser console, you'll see the song data is actually sent over to the client - I just couldn't figure out the JavaScript to make the selection happen.)</li>
                <li><b>Making the app thread- and proces-safe.</b> One serious bug is that the app currently cannot handle simultaneous requests - one user's input would cause server-sent events to be broadcast to not only them, but also other users on the <code>/creating</code> route. I explored using Flask's request-context <code>g</code> object to create a separate "channel" for each user, but it proved beyond me.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Lessons learnt</h3>
            <p>This project felt very apt as a capstone for the CS50x course. It essentially tied together concepts from the entire course, including</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Algorithms and data structures:</b> in implementing the string segmentation algorithm,</li>
                <li><b>SQL:</b> in constructing the database lookups,</li>
                <li><b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:</b> in designing the website,</li>
                <li><b>Flask and HTTP protocols:</b> in putting together the app, and learning the EventSource protocol and more about APIs in general.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This was Mixtape50!</p>
